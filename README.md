# ImmersiveEquipmentMeshGen
Skyrim SE Synthesis Patcher to generate left-hand scabbards for [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001) and [Simple Dual Sheath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50049)

Addresses issues like scabbard straps sticking out by adding mirrored scabbard nodes to existing weapon meshes. These are automatically loaded by IED and SDS on weapons equipped in the left hand.

## Installation
Run the patcher, compress contents of the output folder and install with your mod manager. Place at the end of the load order. Avoid installing as loose files.
